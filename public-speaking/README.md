# Public Speaking

Public speaking is used to educate, entertain and influence. Building good public speaking skills will help you develop confidence, improve your communication skills, and allow you to share your ideas in an effective manner that will help your professional growth. Learning to deliver effective and succinct presentations is very difficult. In order to really master this skill, you will need to practice often.

Public speaking has many professional growth advantages like building confidence, developing better research skills, gaining stronger deductive skills and it allows people to advocate for causes. In this lesson, you'll learn how to identify what makes a good presentation and learn some skills for managing your emotions and success in a presentation setting.

## What is a good presentation?

Presentations can come in all kinds of different formats. From boardrooms to classrooms, there are many opportunities where you must present your thoughts and ideas. While these presentations can vary widely depending on the format, all good presentations share some of the same qualities. In particular, a good presentation informs and engages the audience in an appropriate amount of time.

### Informative presentations

Excellent presenters find ways to inform their audience no matter the topic. This can be difficult to do as, depending on the audience, what it looks like to inform a group can vary widely. For example, a presentation to a group of high schoolers about how the internet works should be very different than a presentation on the same topic to a group of software developers.

To see this in action, consider watching the following video where a computer scientist explains machine learning in varying level of difficulties:

- [Wired: Computer Scientist Explains Machine Learning in 5 Levels of Difficulty](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5q87K1WaoFI)

### Engaging presentations

In addition to being informative, presentations should also be engaging. To understand why, consider some of the best lessons you've been a part of, either in this program or in other educational settings. While the lesson was likely informative, it was also likely fun and interesting. It is a difficult skill to take seemingly dry information and make it engaging for the audience.

The truth is, just about any topic can come across as dry. Without putting effort into engaging your audience, your presentation is unlikely to be memorable even if the content is informative and interesting on its own.

### Well-timed presentations

Even the best presenters can sometimes overstay their welcome. A well-timed presentation is one that ends right when it needs to -- and not a second later. If a presentation goes on too long it risks becoming less informative or less engaging to the audience.

In many situations, you are given a certain amount of time to fill. In situations like these, it's important to focus on the most important aspects of what you want to present to make sure it fits within the allotted time.

## Public speaking nerves

Many people don't like public speaking. There are a lot of people who will say they even fear or dread it. A lot of the negative feelings about public speaking tend to stem from the anxiety that their presentation won't be good. Unfortunately, one of the few ways to get better at public speaking is to actually do it which means meeting your fear head on.

Thankfully, there are some ways you can cope with the stress associated with public speaking.

### Coping with anxiety

Public speaking tends to be a high-stakes event. It may be the case that a lot of people are watching or that based on your speech important decisions could be made. These high stakes tend to make the speaker feel anxious. Anxiety is often perceived as a negative emotion to be pushed aside.

But, it doesn't have to be this way. Feeling anxious often represents a level of excitement in addition to fear. It also means that you deeply care about the presentation, which is a good thing! While it's difficult to do, accepting that you will feel some anxiety and attempting to reframe it can be beneficial to making it through a presentation.

One of the best ways to help with the negative anxiety of public speaking is to prepare a copious amount.

## Preparation

If you've ever watched a great presentation, you may have felt as though that presenter has a natural talent. While they'd likely appreciate that compliment, great presentations rarely come about because of pure talent. Instead, presenters must practice and prepare an incredible amount. Putting together a great presentation takes a lot of effort and there are many aspects to consider before you step on stage.

### Know Your Audience

The first thing to consider in preparation is who the audience is. Ultimately, you want to keep your audience engaged and interested in what you have to say. To do that, it helps to know a bit about the audience. When considering your audience, it may help to answer the following questions:

- What common attributes do your audience members have? For example, are they all in the same industry?
- What are their goals in coming to your presentation? For example, are they looking to be sold a new technology or are they coming to meet you?
- What shared knowledge can you assume of your audience members? For example, are they novice software engineers or expert programmers?

This last point is important as it can vastly affect how you present your content. For example, if the audience is very technical, a technical presentation where you present your technical design decisions may be in order. However, if the audience is less technical, you may instead choose to focus on what that technical work drives towards. That is, focusing on the features as opposed to the way those features work.

Simple and clear explanations that strive to inform the audience will demonstrate your understanding and communication skills better than a muddled explanation with a lot of buzzwords. Breaking down a tough concept into something that more people can understand takes time and practice. In working on this explanation, you will likely have to do some research and do a deeper exploration of what you want to discuss.

Your audience may be people you know, in which case a more casual tone can be better. But, if there are a lot of people you don't know, being more formal is generally more acceptable. This consideration will help set the tone of your overall presentation.

Taking the time to clarify who your target audience is and how to best engage them will help elevate your presentation.

### Organization

Your presentation should have a clear and coherent organization. Consider your presentation like a story in that it should have a clear beginning, middle, and end. Your job is to guide your audience through the story and do the work to make sure they don't get lost along the way.

Generally, a presentation is made up of the following:

- An introduction to the presenter(s)
- An introduction to the topic at hand and why the audience should care
- An explanation of the topic
- A conclusion

When preparing a presentation, start by making a list of the major points that need to be made during your presentation. Then, consider how each of those points fits together and organize them appropriately. Once you have your main points organized, it will be easier to fill out those points with details.

#### An example

Imagine you are making a presentation on how to grow your own vegetables. You have the following important points you want to make:

- It's easy to under or over-water most vegetables.
- The type of soil you choose matters a lot.
- Picking the right location for your plants is very important.

When constructing your presentation, you would think of how to introduce yourself and the topic to your audience. Then you'll need to decide how to address all of these points. While there is no absolute "right" way to go about this, consider the following two ways of writing your "story" about growing vegetables.

1. Talk about how the _location_ of your plant matters a lot in that it can determine how much _water_ your plant gets. Since it can be easy to _over-water your plants_, you may want to put them in a location that gets a natural amount of rain or _can be easily controlled._ The _type of soil_ you choose can also help regulate water and provide other benefits.

1. The most common mistake people make is to not provide the _right amount of water to their plants._ To mitigate this, you must consider how much you water in addition to the _location of your plants,_ in the event they are outside. Improving the type of _soil you use_ can also help alleviate some issues that occur with watering.

Both of narratives above cover essentially the same points, but the order in which those points are covered differs slightly. However, each point leads into the next. When designing a presentation, you will want to think about how your different points intersect and overlap.

### Practice

If you are relatively new to making presentations, make a full script of what you want to say. Practice it and edit it again and again along with your slide deck. When you practice, you should practice in a way that mimics the real presentation as best as you can. Immediately address your posture, tone, voice projection, speaking speed, and timing of the presentation. For some people, it even helps to dress up for practice.

After a certain amount of practice, you should not need your script, but rather some cue cards or speaker notes. When you can deliver your presentation well with just some speaker notes, you are then ready to present. You shouldn't have to memorize your script, rather you should have become knowledgeable enough about your topic and your presentation that you can speak about it rather comfortably.

When you first start, the amount of prep time for a presentation can be extremely long. With more practice and experience it will become a bit faster and easier.

If you're feeling a bit lost on how to improve your presentations, consider watching the following video which provides some public speaking tips.

### Style and presentation

Once you have a good grasp of your content, the next thing to tackle is the overall presentation.

A presentation is a performance and therefore you will need to be more mindful of your body language and voice during the presentation. You should have good posture, and project your voice in a way like you are trying to talk to your friend who happens to be across the room. Make deliberate eye contact a few times throughout your presentation, and manage the speed of your words. When excited or anxious, most people tend to talk much too fast.

Just like other performances, practice is the key to success. Try practicing in a few different ways, such as by yourself alone in a room, in front of a mirror, or even with your friends, family, and colleagues.

Consider filming yourself while you practice, so that you can then view what your presentation looks like. While watching yourself speak can be awkward, it is usually one of the more informative ways of learning what you need to work on.

As you present, your nervous energy should shift into excited energy that you are willing to share with your audience.

Your appearance should be neat and in line with the dress code of the event. Wear things that are comfortable and that you feel confident in. It's important that you present yourself in a way that people remember you more than what you might have worn.

#### Presenting with Others

If you are doing a group presentation, make sure to practice with each other. Be sure to clarify who is doing which part ahead of time.

Keep things positive and supportive when presenting.

## Slide decks

Most presentations are expected to have a slide deck to accompany them or something else visual to demonstrate (e.g. a demonstration of an app).

Slide decks, in general, should have a cohesive design theme that suits the content. Your content should be centered or aligned in a way that is neat and non-distracting.

If you are not a designer, keep things simple. Choose a template that has already been designed and do not worry about adding anything extra. If you are a designer, use the deck as another venue to show your skills.

Slides should be highly visual, have very limited text and be self-explanatory. There should be titles and labels for each slide. Each slide should be treated as at least somewhat complete on its own. For example, if someone looked at just one of your slides they may say:

- This is the title page of someone's slide deck giving a presentation next week...
- This is a graph that shows the usage of something over some amount of time...
- These are four great reasons to do something...

The slides should not contain long blocks of text that the presenter would either read off of or ask the audience to read.

The content should feel cohesive and align with your outline.

If you are struggling to put your thoughts into words, consider if you understand what you are trying to say well enough. Fuzzy thinking leads to fuzzy writing. If needed, go back, research, and study what you want to say more until you can say it clearly.

If you know what you want to say, but it is written in an awkward way that you can't figure out how to correct, reach out for help. A fresh set of eyes can help a lot.

Take the time to fix every single spelling and grammatical error.

### Effectiveness

People, generally, don't have long attention spans and can get easily distracted. However, a great slide deck with a great lead-in will help them stay focused and interested in what you want to say.

You will likely be given a certain amount of time to present. That will help determine the level of detail of the slide deck.

Make sure every sentence bullet point says something meaningful. For example, this bullet point informs the audience of nothing in particular:

- Apps are an important part of life

On the other hand, this bullet point conveys something meaningful:

- Our app is designed to help users spend up to 20% less time a week on X tasks by doing Y.

Your points should be self-sufficient. Your average audience member should not need to open their phone and start googling for definitions of words or acronyms to follow along with your presentation. Take the time to define or simplify things.

## Answering questions

At the end of many presentations, it's normal to set aside some time for the audience to ask questions. This is typically called a "Questions and Answers" section, or Q&A.

When the Q&A section beings, take a moment to check your posture and take a deep breath.

When asked a question, it is typically good practice to repeat the question back so that everyone in the room can hear it. Doing so can also help you clarify if you understand the question. It also might buy you a little bit of time to put together your answer.

### No questions

If you don't get any questions it might not be a bad thing. Sometimes you are presenting towards the end of an event and people are a little bit tired, but still paying attention to you. Sometimes there is a time crunch. Or, you might have shared a lot of information and people need a little bit more time with what you shared before forming a question. So don't panic if you don't get any questions. Just let the clock run down and gracefully wrap up.

### Bad Questions

Not everyone is great at asking questions. Just do your best to keep it positive, and polite, and try not to get defensive.

People can ask very off-topic questions or questions that are well beyond the scope of what your presentation was about. For example, if you presenting a prototype of an application to demonstrate your technical skills, someone could ask about what the marketing for this product might look like.

If someone asks a question like this, it's best to be polite and answer it as best you can. However, you should feel free to say that it's something you haven't thought of yet or offer to get back to the person. Ultimately, you just want the question asker to feel valued.

If you get asked a question that seems off-topic, you could respond in one of the following ways:

- "I think that's beyond the scope of this presentation. Our goal was to demonstrate that this app does X."
- "There were time constraints that did not allow us to address the issue you're talking about. Instead, we focused on X and Y."
- "We are very interested in solving that issue in a future iteration."
- "I think the situation you're discussing is very specific. Let's meet after the presentation to discuss this in more depth if you'd like."

## Issues

There is something about presentations where there is a tendency for unexpected things to go wrong. Just as buttered toast tends to land butter side down, it just is this way, for everyone. Even if you practiced a hundred times flawlessly, something unexpected will likely happen during your actual presentation that never happened during your practice.

Aside from being well-rehearsed the next best thing you can do is stay cool under pressure. Figuring out how to work through whatever issue you are facing on your feet gracefully is an excellent sign of professional development.
